# ss14-wizden-maps

This repo was created to keep track of and archive all Wizden maps that are either currently live or have been rotated out.
If there are any maps that I've missed please let me know on the Wizden Discord, my user is scrubdelub. 

This was an idea that was brought up by Compilatron in the Wizden Space Station 14 Discord server.

## Guidelines/Definitions
This is how I am currently organizing these maps:

### Maps are either Live or Removed
- A Live map is a map that you could switch to if you made a fresh clone of the repo and used the mapping command in game to get there.
- A Removed map is a map that you ==cannot== switch to if you made a fresh clone of the repo.

### Live Maps are either in the Standard Rotation or require Admin Intervention 
- The Standard Rotation includes Station maps, Shuttles, all salvage related maps, nukie planet, centcom, and arrivals 
- Admin Intervention maps includes... well, all maps that require Admin Intervention to access. E.g., Test maps, deathmatch, Relic.

### Removed Maps are organized by Station or Shuttle
- There is a folder for things that I have no guidelines on organizing ("unsureWhatTheseWere"), this is supposed to be temporary (here's hoping).

## TO DO
- Reorganize live shuttle maps to make Admin Inverened maps have their shuttles in AdminIntervention (E.g. Relic's shuttle should be in a directory called Shuttle in AdminIntervention)
- Reorganize maps to include their Prototypes: You need the prototypes to run the maps properly
- Reorganize the Salv related maps: I'm not sure how I'd go about it yet, so, we'll see what happens.
- Find remaining Removed & Admin Event Maps: This repo is missing a few removed maps (Kettle, Lighthouse(old centcom), core 1, moose 1), and all the admin event maps (dunno how it's gonna happen but it's gotta happen)
- Figure out guidelines for others to assist with the repo (we'll see if this happens, hopefully)
- probably something else that I can't think of at this moment...

---
## Stretch Goal
- Organize each map into their own folder with previous (major) versions of the map and a document stating author, version, and whatever else is needed for archiving sake
