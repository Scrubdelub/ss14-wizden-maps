# ss14-wizden-maps

This repo was created to keep track of and archive all Wizden maps that are either currently live or have been rotated out.
If there are any maps that I've missed please let me know on the Wizden Discord, my user is scrubdelub. 

This was an idea that was brought up by Compilatron in the Wizden Space Station 14 Discord server.
